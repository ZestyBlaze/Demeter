# Demeter

## Inspiration
A lot of the inspiration for this mod comes from multiple parts, a lot of credit goes to the old Harvest Festival mod, which this is very much based off of, while drawing a lot of inspiration from games such as Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon!
I wanted to create a mod that felt like Harvest Festival again while putting my own twist on it, and from those thoughts came.. whatever this is

## Configuration
Most of this mod can be configured with either changing values around in `config/demeter-common.json` or you can provide integration with this mod and other animal mods by adding onto the custom datamaps provided by Demeter!
